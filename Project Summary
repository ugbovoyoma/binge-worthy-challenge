## **Key Findings**

### **1. Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows**

- **Movies**: 6131 (69.62%)
- **TV Shows**: 2676 (30.38%)

Netflix's concentration on binge-worthy programs is evident in the fact that while movies make up the majority of its collection, TV shows also account for a sizable chunk.

### **2. Most Common Genres**

- **Top 3 Genres**:
  - International Movies: 2752 titles
  - Dramas: 2427 titles
  - Comedies: 1674 titles

Netflix offers a wide range of programming, with a particular focus on dramatic and international shows.


### **3. Content Growth Over the Years**

- **Growth Accelerated in 2015**:  
  Content additions peaked in **2019**:
  - **Movies**: Over 1400 titles added
  - **TV Shows**: Approximately 600 titles added

Content contributions decreased after 2019, which might have been due to external limitations or a change in strategy.


### **4. Average Duration**

- **Movies**: Average duration is **99.58 minutes**.
- **TV Shows**: Average duration is **1.76 seasons**.

The shorter duration of TV shows aligns with modern binge-watching trends.
